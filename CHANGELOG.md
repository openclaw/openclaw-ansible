# Changelog - Multi-OS Support & Bug Fixes

## Unreleased

- Add optional NetBird support and safer Tailscale authentication/operator controls; VPN migrations retain the working provider until its replacement is ready, while an empty provider preserves independently managed VPN state. Reconciliation covers stopped-daemon authority, keeps provider identities, preserves self-hosted NetBird endpoints in welcome guidance, and limits Tailscale sudo access to read-only diagnostics.
- Fix local installation failing after package setup by removing tasks that reference the deleted banner template; run the Docker installer harness in CI.
- Reuse fresh apt metadata on repeated installations while refreshing immediately when the NodeSource repository is added.
- Remove unused configuration, service, and banner templates; document the native Gateway and onboarding-owned security configuration accurately. Thanks @tosin2013 for the report.
- Update the Ansible lint toolchain and GitHub Actions dependencies, with Python 3.14 for CI.
- Exclude checkout metadata and local Ansible caches from Docker test images so the harness also works from Git worktrees.
- Preserve service-user privilege switching in the Docker test harness to avoid recurring pnpm ownership changes.
- Remove the OpenClaw service user from the root-equivalent Docker group, including on existing installations. Thanks @Tonynanra for the report.
- Document expected results for post-install security verification and link the checks from setup documentation. Thanks @justinfiore for the report.

### 🚀 Workflow Changes

#### Old Workflow
```bash
# Installation
curl -fsSL https://.../install.sh | bash
sudo -i -u openclaw              # ❌ Wrong command
nano ~/.openclaw/config.yml      # Manual config
openclaw login                   # Manual setup
# Missing DBus setup              # ❌ Errors
```

#### New Workflow - Release Mode (Default)
```bash
# Installation
curl -fsSL https://.../install.sh | bash
sudo su - openclaw               # ✅ Correct command
openclaw onboard --install-daemon # ✅ One command setup!
# DBus auto-configured             # ✅ Works
# Service auto-installed           # ✅ Works
```

#### New Workflow - Development Mode
```bash
# Installation with development mode
git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw-ansible.git
cd openclaw-ansible
./run-playbook.sh -e openclaw_install_mode=development

# Switch to openclaw user
sudo su - openclaw

# Make changes
openclaw-dev              # cd ~/code/openclaw
vim src/some-file.ts      # Edit code
openclaw-rebuild          # pnpm build

# Test immediately
openclaw doctor           # Uses new build
```

### 🎯 User Experience Improvements

#### Welcome Message
- Shows environment status (XDG_RUNTIME_DIR, DBUS, Homebrew, OpenClaw version)
- Recommends `openclaw onboard --install-daemon` as primary command
- Provides manual setup steps as alternative
- Lists useful commands for troubleshooting

#### Environment Configuration
- Homebrew automatically added to PATH
- pnpm global bin directory configured
- DBus session bus properly initialized
- XDG_RUNTIME_DIR set for systemd user services

#### Directory Structure
Ansible creates only structure, no config files:
```
~/.openclaw/
├── sessions/       # Created (empty)
├── credentials/    # Created (secure: 0700)
├── data/          # Created (empty)
└── logs/          # Created (empty)
# openclaw.json    # NOT created - user's openclaw creates it
# config.yml       # NOT created - deprecated
```

### 🔒 Security Enhancements

#### Systemd Service Hardening
- `ProtectSystem=strict` - System directories read-only
- `ProtectHome=read-only` - Limited home access
- `ReadWritePaths=~/.openclaw` - Only config writable
- `NoNewPrivileges=true` - No privilege escalation

#### User Isolation
- Dedicated openclaw system user
- lingering enabled for systemd user services
- Proper DBus session isolation
- XDG_RUNTIME_DIR per-user

### 📊 Platform Support Matrix

| Feature | Debian/Ubuntu | macOS | Status |
|---------|--------------|-------|--------|
| Base Installation | ✅ | ✅ | Tested |
| Homebrew | ✅ | ✅ | Working |
| Docker | Docker CE | Docker Desktop | Working |
| Firewall | UFW | Application FW | Working |
| systemd | ✅ | ❌ | Linux only |
| DBus Setup | ✅ | N/A | Linux only |
| pnpm + OpenClaw | ✅ | ✅ | Working |

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

1. **User Switch Command Changed**
   - Old: `sudo -i -u openclaw`
   - New: `sudo su - openclaw`
   - Impact: Update documentation, scripts

2. **No Auto-Configuration**
   - Old: config.yml auto-created
   - New: User runs `openclaw onboard`
   - Impact: Users must run onboard command

3. **No Auto-Service Install**
   - Old: systemd service auto-installed
   - New: `openclaw onboard --install-daemon`
   - Impact: Service not running after ansible

### 🔄 Migration Guide

#### For Fresh Installations
Just run the new installer - everything works out of the box!

#### For Existing Installations
```bash
# 1. Add environment variables
echo 'export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)' >> ~/.bashrc

# 2. Enable lingering
sudo loginctl enable-linger openclaw

# 3. Add Homebrew (Linux)
echo 'eval "$(/home/linuxbrew/.linuxbrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.bashrc

# 4. Reload
source ~/.bashrc

# 5. Reinstall openclaw
pnpm install -g openclaw@latest
```
